  Purpose of this analysis to create a webpage.

## Resources

## Result

1. Created elements like date,state,country,city and shape.
2. Created an empty filters variable to keep track of all the elements that change when a search is entered.
3. Created two functions:updateFilters() and filterTable()
    - filterTable()  will filter the table data by the value that is entered for the "id" that has changed.
    - updateFilters() will update the filters based on user input.
4. buildTable(tableData) function at the end of the starter code, modify the event listener, so that it detects a "change" on each input element and calls the              updateFilters() function.
5. Created a variable that saves the element that was changed using d3.select(this).
6. Use of if-else statement to check if the values was changed by users.

## Summary
